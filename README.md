We introduce <em>Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS)</em> for masked diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations: (i) quantized expectation, which provides gradient-like guidance for discrete diffusion with purely discrete embedding space, and (ii) anchored remasking, which enables adaptive decoding during inference. Our method supports a variety of linear and nonlinear image restoration tasks (left three columns), as well as mask-based garment styling and reference-guided style transfer (last column).
